Installation
============

If your Linux distribution has a package manager based on the DEB
package format, like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and others, you
can create a tar.gz file containing the DEB binary and shell scripts
to install and uninstall them. On other distributions you can
directly build and install everything to /usr/local.

Scripts ending with .py usually have many more options than described
here. Use the --help option to list them.


Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other DEB based systems
------------------------------------------------------

To build the DEB you need the following packages

  $ apt-get install debhelper g++ cmake python3 \
                    libglibmm-2.4-dev

The command, from the directory of this file, is

  $ ./scripts/debian_create.py --builddir=~/Tmp/builddir

where builddir must be an non existent or empty folder. This builds
a Debian source package and from it the binary package using Debian
specific tools. In the same builddir it creates the zip

  fofimon-dist.tar.gz  containing install and uninstall scripts
                       and the DEB binary package

Once unzipped in a folder just run the script

  $ ./install-bin.sh

which uses 'dpkg -i' to install the DEB.

The corresponding ./uninstall-bin.sh script is also available.


Other distributions
-------------------

Needed packages for building:
- libglibmm-2.4-dev
- g++ and cmake
- python3

From this directory execute the following commands:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  ..

Instead of 'Release' CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can also be set to
   'Debug', 'MinSizeRel' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
To change the default installation directory add definition
   '-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local'  to the preceding command.

  $ make

  $ sudo make install


Alternatively you can just execute the script

  $ ./scripts/install_fofimon.py  -b Release  --installdir /usr/local

setting the parameter(s) to your preferred value (like above).

  $ ./scripts/install_fofimon.py  --help

for a description of all available options.
